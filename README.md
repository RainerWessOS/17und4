# Daddelkiste-Disco-Points

Javascript implementation of an "advanced slot machine", a penny arcade casino game.

Uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Images.

This version - Disco Points - is with Points only, no special games. 
If you like special games you may have a look on my other project Daddelkiste_Disco_fun.


Works on all modern browsers. Game can be played on touch-devices like smartfones or tablets. Everything needed to play the game is in the zip-package. If you download and unzip it, you can play it stand alone - without internet connection.

New Version 0.90 now with multi-language support (de,en,fr,es,pt,it,nl,sv), the game automatically starts in the language of your browser.
