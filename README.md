# Daddelkiste-Disco-Points

Simulation of a Penny Arcade

Javascript implementation of an "advanced slot machine", a penny arcade casino game.
This Version - Disco Points - is with Points only, no special games. 
If you like special games you may have a look on my other projekt Daddelkiste_Disco_fun.
Uses HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Images.

Works on all modern Browsers. Game can be played on Touch-Devices like Smartfones or Tablets. Everything needed to play the game is in the package. If you download and unzip it, you can play it stand alone - without internet connection.

New Version 0.90 now with multi-language support, the game automatically starts in the language of your browser.
